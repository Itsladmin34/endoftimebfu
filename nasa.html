<b> Hello </b><br>
<Hr>
<p> I have a <b><i>huge crush</b></i> on you since May-July of 2022. i don't know but it happened automatically.</p>
<p>
Well today i want freindship from you.Just frendship because according to me love is not about the tag of bf or gf but about, good nature and true trust. And this nature can be generated for anyone no matter whether person is friend, brother, parents, sister or anything. Before you are going to take any decision on that i would like to mention few incident which make me to like you so hard...</p>

<p> last year when i got low percentage in report card of 9th standard then almost all of my wishes were lost but after meeting a person like you, my wishes and goals were regained... and i start doing hard work again. I want to thanks you for this <span>ðŸ˜Š</span> by my heart. Few days ago you mention in your story that if u make someone happy then u also feel happy. at this time i can say yes you make me feel happy <span>ðŸ˜Š</span><span>ðŸ˜Š</span>.</p>

<p>

I wanted to know your name but did not dare to ask you at that time. On 7 September 2022 when you come to our class to talk with Manheer (in 0 or 1st period)Yashvi called you and that time I came to know your real name...</p>
<p>
Do you remember when you came to our class and ask for civics notebook from Prince(6 october 2022)... that time i also want to gave you mine notebook, but my notes was incomplete. So I sat till 12 that night and finished all the civics notes, but the next day(7 october 2022) when you came again, I could not muster up the courage to talk to you. Which leave a mark of regretion and sadness on me, after that most of the time you keep roaming in my mind and now boards are also coming additionally year is also going to end so that's why i am expressing my feelings to you.After expressing my feelings to you the traces of regretion and anxiety will disappear from me. </p>

<p>
Well maybe you wonders to know but i still hold record of these dates in my short diary <span>ðŸ˜…</span></p>

<p>
I get your instagram id from public account of Subh Solanki. I saw your account in recommendation of subh and without any further thoughts i sended  request to u (well still i am a stranger of subh he also doesn't know my true identity).When i came to know that you have a crush on a boy of 11th standerd, i felt very sad but in this case i have not any right to comment on this Everyone have different choices .
</p>

<p>
I am quite introvert. I have not any real friends even most of the time i sit alone in the class...</p>

<p>
I am not so tall and handsome. I just want your friendship so can you accept my little request? Sorry again if you feel insecure after reading this <span>ðŸ™‡</span>. I not want to make you feel insecure i also have mother and sister in my house i truly respect your feelings and thoughts that's why i am asking for freindship not for the tag of gf bf. If u are not accepting this then forgot all of this conversation which we done today i know i will be quite sad after that but i can't able to force you in this case. Please tell me the reason also.i am going to work on it. Plz make your decision after keeping yourself at my place  (plz... I think i am not asking something big but...)and if you want to take your time about it then you can take. If our exam center is same then we can meet there also. You can take your decision after that meeting also...
</p>
<p>
Best of luck for your boards exam
</p><p>
Again sorry but can u be my friend?
